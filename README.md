# TTK4900 - Engineering Cybernetics, Master's Thesis


This code is the implementation of a thesis that explores the potential of unsupervised machine learning methods for
in-situ plankton image classification. The research was driven by the need to overcome the limitations of supervised methods, which necessitate extensive annotated datasets and struggle with classifying unseen plankton. Employing Invariant
Information Clustering (IIC) and two variants of Regularized Information Maximization (RIM), outperforming previous unsupervised techniques by 11%, reaching
an accuracy of 24.9% on the NDSB dataset. A novel variant of RIM using selective
image transformations for augmentation was introduced, surpassing the performance of the IMSAT method.
Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) proved to be an effective evaluation metric
for unsupervised methods when dataset labels are not available. Despite computational constraints and the assumption of known dataset classes, the findings imply
a substantial potential for unsupervised machine learning methods in plankton
image classification.
Application for in-situ classification necessitates an additional manual post classification step by a plankton expert to label clusters. Despite these limitations, the
results suggest promising avenues for future research. The presented methods
mark an advancement in the field of plankton image classification, with potential
benefits for marine ecosystem monitoring and the study of environmental impacts.
